# Title
Analysis of a data set on university faculty perceptions and practices of using Wikipedia as a teaching resource. 

# Introduction
The objective of the data analysis is to predict the “use behavior” of Wikipedia by teachers, based on their responses to survey questions as well as their ”demographic” attributes (e.g., age, teaching experience, gender, field of study, etc.). The data was obtained from a survey sent to part-time and full-time professors at two Spanish universities –   Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC) and Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UOC) –  in 2013 -2013. 

The particular Use behavior variable of interest, Use3, represented the responses of whether the teachers recommended the students to use Wikipedia. This response variable is highly correlated with Use4 (whether Wikipedia use was recommended to colleagues), Use5 (the perception of the teachers of whether the students used Wikipedia in their courses), and Use1 (whether the teachers use Wikipedia to develop teaching materials). Therefore, Use3 in general was representative of most the Use behavior survey items in the data set.
